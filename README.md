This is my secure chat app that I am creating as part of my monash course.

Currently, my app allows for users to create an account that is secured by a hashed password. And to search for any other account.
completed: 
- user authentication to the root server via login (password-based authentication)

Still to complete
- allow messaging between users
- end-end a-symmetric key encryption between users (allowing users to find their own symmetric key)
- end-end symmetric key encryption between users
- tampering detection
- capture data using wireshark
- running confidentiality attacks against data
