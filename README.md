This is my secure chat app that I am creating as part of my monash course.

Currently, my app allows for users to create an account that is secured by a hashed password. And to search for any other account.
completed: 
- user authentication to the root server via login (password-based authentication)
- I am using socket.io to try and create the connections for private messaging.
- I can send messages using socket.io. however these messages are not stored for later use. so if the user is not there to see the message when it is sent. then they will never see the message at all. (maybe a problem, not sure yet)



Still to complete
- end-end a-symmetric key encryption between users (allowing users to find their own symmetric key)
- end-end symmetric key encryption between users
- tampering detection
- capture data using wireshark
- running confidentiality attacks against data 
- maybe some more ui fixes
